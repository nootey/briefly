        "Congratulations on your SLA Mini Grant Award and welcome to the 21-22 SLA Mini Grant Business Meeting. This webinar will cover the requirements, timeline, and recommendations for grantees to complete the grant successfully.",
        "Grantees must complete this webinar, along with the Supporting Beginning Readers modules on Niche Academy, before their grant funds will be released. Please watch to the very end as this webinar is packed with information grantees will need throughout the grant year.",
        "The program lead for the School Library Access Mini Grant Program is me, Jeannie Standall, and ICFL's Grants Officer, Jamie Mott, supports this grant on the finance side. We are both available to address whatever questions, concerns, or issues might come up during the program year.",
        "One of the documents in your grant package is a sheet with our contact information, so please refer to it when you're ready to submit your grant. Please don't hesitate to reach out.",
        "This business meeting is all about the what of the grant, the requirements that must be met, and the rules that must be followed.",
        "It is necessary information for managing the money part of the grant, but once you've completed the Supporting Beginning Readers modules, you'll have a bit more information about why these rules and requirements are in place.",
        "We'll cover a little bit of that information today in this business meeting, but know that if you've not yet been through the modules, you'll have a little bit more information about why these rules and requirements are in place.",
        "There's a lot more information coming your way that will put the requirements into context. Let's start with the goals of the grant. As you make decisions about your grant implementation, it's hard to go wrong if you keep the goals of the grant in mind.",
        "For Round 1 grantees, the goals are to increase the amount of reading done in the homes of children in developmental preschool programs, kindergarten, and first grade. Increase access to age-appropriate quality education.",
        "Increase access to age-appropriate quality fiction and nonfiction titles in elementary school libraries. And to increase the number of children reading on grade level.",
        "For Round 2 and upper elementary grants, the goal is to increase the amount of reading done in the homes of students in all elementary grades. And to increase access to age-appropriate quality nonfiction and fiction titles in elementary school libraries.",
        "And we want to increase the number of kids reading on grade level, of course. For Round 2 grantees, one more goal of your grant is to help increase school libraries' financial support from their school districts.",
        "This year's Big Picture shows we've awarded $154,000 to 34 elementary schools from every part of the state. There were 13 Round 1 grants, 18 Round 2 grants, and three schools were awarded the newest mini-grant, the Upper Elementary Grant.",
        "Our grant period this year stretches from August 16 to April 18. During the week of September 16, you were sent your grant package via email.",
        "Included as attachments were your grantee map, your grant application, which also serves as your grant agreement, a list of best practices and pro tips that we've learned over the nearly 10 years of administering this grant program, a detailed grant timeline, and a copy of your award letter.",
        "On our website at libraries.idaho.gov, you'll find the questions to expect on the interim and final grant reports, and an example showing what your financial report should look like. First, let's take a look at the map. This is this year's cohort of mini-grant recipients.",
        "Note those folks that may be near you, or maybe not near you. Sometimes a group of people doing the same thing that you're doing can really provide a lot of support and advice. On our website, there's a map like this of last year's mini-grant recipients, too.",
        "Perhaps you'd like to talk with someone with a bit of experience running this grant, especially through a COVID year. If that sounds like a good idea to you, contact me and I can connect you with someone. Now take a look at your award letter. There is some useful information there for you.",
        "First, your grant number is in the first paragraph. Be sure to include your grant number with your reporting. We have several schools this year with similar names, so this will really help keep your grant records together. Next, there is a link to the SLA mini-grant webpage.",
        "This page is the home for lots of information that you'll need during the grant year. It's a good idea to bookmark it. Also, at the bottom of the letter is contact information for Jeannie and Jamie. This year, like last year, we have a lot of information.",
        "We just don't know what the school year might hold. So it's best to be prepared. In your application, you described a contingency plan to meet the requirements of this grant, whether school is in-person, remote, or some combination of the two.",
        "It's possible the library will be open to students, operating remotely, or somewhere in between. With those possibilities in mind, let's take a minute to think about the requirements of your grant and the barriers to meet those requirements.",
        "First, how will books be circulated to your students, especially the grades targeted in your grant, if your library is closed or if your school is remote? How will all your grant money be expended if you or your financial team find yourself working from home? How can family literacy events be held remotely or virtually? How will you have access to the data you need to complete your report? How will you be able to access your library? How will you be able to complete your reports if you're working from home? Are there other issues to consider that are unique to your school? Now, think about what you did last year to get books into the hands of your kids and keep them reading all year long, whether or not they were at your school.",
        "What worked and what didn't? Whether you're a veteran at dealing with the quick pivot or this is your first time in the library, now is the time to plan for these contingencies. If you've got questions or need a sounding board, give me a call or shoot me an email.",
        "We can chat or I can put you in touch with a current or past grantee who worked with this grant during COVID. Here is a rundown of the grant requirement highlights. We'll be going into more detail about these as we make our way through the webinar, but here is a quick overview.",
        "For all three SLA mini grants, the students in the grades targeted in the grant must be able to check out and take home at least two books per week, and that should start in the first semester of school.",
        "Round 1 grants are concerned with kindergarten and first grade and pre-K if your school serves them. Round 2 and upper elementary grants should apply this requirement to all students who attend the school. All students should be allowed to check out and take home nonfiction titles.",
        "In this year's grant funds are not required, but in the past, some grantees have been so short on nonfiction they've been unable to allow all students to check them out. If you're in this situation, we hope these grant funds will help get more nonfiction into the collection.",
        "Which leads us to the next requirement for all types of grants. 40% of grant funds must be spent on nonfiction titles. All grant funds must be spent on appropriate fiction or nonfiction for the grade levels targeted in your grant.",
        "Round 1 grantees, that means you should spend all your grant funds on titles that are in the pre-K to grade 1 interest level and maybe some grade 2 interest level as well.",
        "Round 2 grantees, you may spend up to 20% of your grant funds on allowable purchases to meet the outreach and family literacy event requirements of the grant. More on that later. This year, ebooks and eaudiobooks are allowable purchases with these grant funds.",
        "Digital materials like this are very useful, especially when we're working and learning remotely or when kids can't come to the library to get print materials. There are, however, some considerations for ebooks and eaudiobooks.",
        "If you invest in eMaterials, how will your students access them? Do they have an internet connection available to them? Can they download at school? Does your school's Wi-Fi extend to the parking lot for after-hours access? Do students have a device on which to read? Many students have become one-to-one schools where each student is issued a device, but many have not.",
        "If not, are there devices students can borrow from the library to take home? Do students and parents have the know-how to access and check out digital materials from outside the school building, or are they the parents of your youngest students who may need help downloading materials? Is there a plan in place to maintain titles bought with grant funds? Some ebooks and eaudio titles expire after a time limit, and some expire after a number of circulations.",
        "It's important to understand how each vendor manages those details for each title you purchase. Speaking of ebooks and eaudio, take a look at the idea of what ebooks and eaudio are.",
        "You can find the idea on the Idaho Digital Ebook Alliance page at libraries.idaho.gov and check out all the titles there. If your school district has not already, you can join IDEA and have access to thousands of titles appropriate for K-12 students.",
        "This collection is purchased and managed by ICFL. Joining IDEA costs your school and your school district nothing. You get access by joining the Alliance, and students access the collection with the Sora app. Dozens of Idaho school districts have joined and are using the collection.",
        "If you haven't already, get all the details on the website and then contact me, Jeannie, Tammy Holley-Haus, or Dylan Baker for more details. There are a few things that cannot be purchased with these grant funds.",
        "AR tests and supplies are not allowable purchases with these funds, nor are subscription services. There are some really helpful subscription services available, like Junior Library Guild. But the subscription model and timeline does not work with this grant timeline.",
        "Food is not an allowable purchase with these funds. However, up to 5% of grant funds may be used on book processing supplies. If you're a Round 2 grantee, that 5% is considered part of the 20% that you're allowed to use for purchases other than books. Here are some dates that should be considered.",
        "The dates should be on your calendar. There's a more detailed timeline in your grant package, and these are some required deadlines. There are two grant reports for this grant, an interim report due January 14, and a final report due April 29.",
        "On March 1, 2022, all of your grant funds must be obligated, meaning there should be a purchase order filed accounting for all the grant dollars. On March 31, all, meaning every penny, of your grant funds must be spent. The check must be written. On April 1, all unspent funds must be returned.",
        "Take a look at the detailed grant timeline in your grant package, which is more detailed than this one. The black print is a recommended timeline that can be useful for pacing, but the red print shows required deadlines.",
        "Please put these dates in whatever calendar you live by, along with reminders about a week before. There is no wiggle room on the dates by which money must be obligated and spent. In August, we completed most of the business meetings and got started on the Supporting Beginning Readers modules.",
        "In September, we're finishing up the Supporting Beginning Readers modules, and grant funds should be distributed by the end of the month via electronic funds transfer. In October, grantees will want to place their first and largest book order.",
        "And in November, it's a good time to place that second book order. In January and February is when the American Library Association announces the Youth Media Awards, so some grantees may want to keep a little bit of money to purchase those books after they're announced.",
        "January the 14th is when the interim report is due. And February is a good time to double-check those back-up dates. You can also use back orders to ensure that the funds that you think are spent are actually spent.",
        "In March, 100% of the grant funds must be obligated, and then by the end of March, all of the grant funds must be spent. And April 29th is when your final report is due. We've been at this for a while now, and we've discovered that there are several things successful grantees do.",
        "We thought you'd like to know these tips from others' experience. After this business meeting, establish a location where you keep all grant-related documents. You've been sent all the documents via email this year, so print those out and put them in that spot.",
        "Read the full grant application agreement, the interim and final report questions, and be sure you understand the requirements and what data should be collected and how to collect it. Add all the grant deadlines to your calendars, and then go ahead and add pre-deadline reminders.",
        "Bookmark libraries.idaho.gov/school-access-mini-grants and keep that link handy. Find out in advance how to order books and pay vendors, and request grant expenditure reports through your district office and its processes.",
        "Learn how long that purchase cycle takes, and make sure that the district has a copy of the application and agreement and understands your reporting requirements. And finally, post the ICFL contact sheet, and use that as a resource, and call or email any time you have questions.",
        "And please keep us in the loop if you have grant staff changes. This grant cohort is a large group and communicates with the community.."
