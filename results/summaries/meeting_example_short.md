The meeting focused on the strategic implementation and management of the SLA Mini Grant Program for the 2021-2022 year. Key points included:

1. **Program Overview and Requirements**: Grantees must complete a webinar and the Supporting Beginning Readers modules on Niche Academy before funds are released. The program is led by Jeannie Standall, with financial support from Jamie Mott.

2. **Grant Goals**: 
   - Round 1 aims to increase reading in homes and access to quality educational materials for preschool to first grade.
   - Round 2 and upper elementary focus on similar goals for all elementary grades, with an additional goal of increasing financial support for school libraries.

3. **Funding and Distribution**: $154,000 was awarded to 34 schools across the state. The grant period runs from August 16 to April 18, with specific deadlines for fund obligation and expenditure.

4. **Implementation Strategies**: Grantees are encouraged to plan for contingencies, such as remote learning scenarios, and ensure students can access books. Digital materials are allowable, but considerations for access and maintenance are necessary.

5. **Financial and Reporting Requirements**: 
   - 40% of funds must be spent on nonfiction titles.
   - Interim and final reports are due on January 14 and April 29, respectively.
   - All funds must be obligated by March 1 and spent by March 31.

6. **Best Practices**: Successful grantees maintain organized documentation, understand reporting requirements, and communicate effectively with district offices. They also utilize resources like the ICFL contact sheet and the SLA mini-grant webpage.

Overall, the meeting emphasized the importance of strategic planning, adherence to deadlines, and effective use of resources to achieve the grant's educational goals.
